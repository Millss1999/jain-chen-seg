#Teeth HW algorithm	// = comments, - = algorithm	see JainChen paper for prob. formulas

-load image
-apply matlab contrast filter
-------------------------
[Bounding Box]
-calculate integral intensities (II = sum of all intensities in row)
	-create sliding window (#cols x w)
	-for loop: sum up all the intensities for a given window row
		-integrated intensity array: II = (row, sum of all intensities in row)
	//every window will give plot (use matlab central file exchange for local min/max)
	-find local minima for each plot

	-set midline (y-hat = #cols/2) or (manually w/ ginput)
	//start calculating probailities
	-calcuate p(yi) for each local minima
	-calculate p(Di) for each local min:
		//intensities are "D's (depths)" //data should be normalized [0,1]
	//find optimal minima for the window using the equations
		//then shift window and repeat for each window

[repeat Bounding box using (opposite window orientation)
	//y-hat for opp direction -> manually set for each gap/larger "sub windows"/
	//loosen guassian equataion -> make sigma bigger
	GOAL: get II + apply equations
[get gap lines from pts]
	-define second degree polynomial for pts (polyfit)
	-creates bounding boxes for gaps
